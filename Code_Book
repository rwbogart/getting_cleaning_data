This file contains the code book for the Getting and Cleaning Data Class Project.  
The source data files and their contents are described in the Readme.Txt file in this repository.
The following steps were taken to create the tidy_data.txt file containing the cleaned data. 
The script to clean and consolidate the data is called run_analysis.R
Before creating the script, I created a repository on Github (with a local replica) call getting_cleaning_data
The script follows these steps:
Step 1
The script verifies that the working directly is set correctly to c:/Users/Randall Bogart/OneDrive/R_Studio/getting_cleaning_data
Then, it tests for the presence of the plyr package in the working environment.  If the package is not present, it installs the package, then loads
and activates the package using the library() function
Step 2
The tables containing the feature names and activity descriptions are loaded
features <- read.table('features.txt', header = FALSE
labels <- read.table('activity_labels.txt', header = FALSE)
The header is set to false in both instances because there is no header line
Step 3
The training information is read into the X_Train and Y_train data frames using the read.table() function, since there are no headers, this is also labeled as FALSE
The subject column is read into the subject_train data frame using the read.table() function
Step 4
The training information is read into the X_test and Y_test data frames using the read.table() function, since there are no headers, this is also labeled as FALSE
The subject column is read into the subject_test data frame using the read.table() function
Step 5
The correct variable names are assigned to the tables before consolidating the data
column names for X_train and Y_test are set to match the corresponding names in the features data frame
The first column in Y_Train and Y_test is named "activityID"
The first column in subject_train and subject test is named "subjectID"
The column names in the labels activity lookup data frame are named "activityID" and activityType"
Step 6
The Y_Test data frame is updated to include a column with the "activityType".
The Y_train data frame is updated to include a column with the "activityType".
A training data frame is created using the cbind() function, linking Y_train, subject_train, and X_train
A test data frame is created using the cbind() function, linking Y_test, subject_test, and X_test
Using rbind (), a combined data frame is created so that all rows from training_data and test_data are consolidated into a single file. 
The column names are captured into a vector named column Names
A data frame contain activityType, subjectID, mean and standard deviation is created
A final data set is then created by only reading in those rows with mean and standard deviation populated
Step 7
A tidy_data data frame is created by aggregated the subject ID, activity type, and mean
Final data cleansing for column headers is complete, capitalizating Mean and Std and removing -
The tidy_data set is then written to the tidy_data.txt output file using the write.table() function
